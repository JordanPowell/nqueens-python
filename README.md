N-Queens Solution - DFS and BFS in Python
-----------------------------------------

This is my attempt at writing a solution for N-Queens in a way that first-year computer science students might be able to grok even if they don't know python.

It's probably best to just read the code at this point. There are two files - one using 'fundamental' programming and the other using python features such as classes and list comprehensions and so on.


I should add a disclaimer that it's not the best way of solving this problem, and it's not the fastest and it's not the easiest. A real program as compared to these two would use more of python's features, and use more classes/functions where appropriate, have proper error handling and be more easily extensible.

If you think I should change something anyway let me know on github.
